    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      I created this travel blog to share my experiences exploring new places
      and to capture what makes each destination unique. My goal is to help
      fellow travelers feel inspired and better prepared by offering honest
      insights, must-see spots, and practical tips from the perspective of
      someone who's been there.
