    <h1>Travelogue: Bora Bora</h1>

    <h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>
      Bora Bora is a small island in French Polynesia known for its
      crystal-clear turquoise lagoon, dramatic volcanic peaks, and luxurious
      overwater bungalows. Often called the “Pearl of the Pacific,” it is a
      popular destination for honeymoons and travelers seeking relaxation and
      natural beauty. The island blends stunning scenery with a laid-back
      Polynesian culture.
